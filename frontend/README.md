## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (Full Stack)

The easiest way to get everything running is with our magical development scripts from the project root:

```bash
# From the project root directory
./start-dev.sh      # 🪄 Starts both frontend + backend servers
./status-dev.sh     # 📊 Check if servers are running
./stop-dev.sh       # 🛑 Stop both servers gracefully
```

This will fire up:
- 🎨 **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- 🔧 **Backend API**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- 📖 **API Docs**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Frontend Only Development

If you just want to work on the frontend (with a running backend elsewhere):

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you're feeling fancy
yarn dev
pnpm dev
bun dev
```

Then cruise over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and watch the magic happen! ✨

### Backend Only

Need just the API server? We've got you covered:

```bash
# From the project root directory
./start-backend.sh  # 🎵 Just the FastAPI server
```

### First Time Setup

1. **Enter your OpenAI API Key** - The app will guide you through this on first launch
2. **Upload a PDF** - Drag & drop any PDF to start the RAG experience
3. **Choose your vibe** - Pick from 12 beautiful color themes in Settings
4. **Start chatting!** - Ask questions about your document or chat normally

## 🧪 Testing

We've got you covered with comprehensive End-to-End testing using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Because broken features are like broken hearts - nobody wants them! 💔

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests on Chrome & Firefox (our reliable duo! 🎸)
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with the fancy Playwright UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests with browser visible (great for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug mode - step through tests like a detective 🔍
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run ALL browsers including WebKit (the adventurous one 🦄)
npm run test:e2e:all
```

### What's Tested

Our test suite is more thorough than a TSA security check:

- ✅ **API Key Flow** - Input validation, navigation, persistence
- ✅ **Settings Modal** - Theme selection, model switching, modal behavior
- ✅ **File Upload** - Drag & drop, progress tracking, document management
- ✅ **Chat Functionality** - Message sending, streaming responses, error handling
- ✅ **UI Theming** - Color application, persistence, visual states
- ✅ **Cross-browser** - Chromium, Firefox, WebKit compatibility

### Test Coverage

- **📱 Responsive Design** - Mobile, tablet, desktop viewports
- **🎨 Theme Persistence** - Colors survive page reloads
- **⚡ Real-time Features** - Progress bars, streaming responses
- **🚨 Error Handling** - API failures, network issues, validation
- **♿ Accessibility** - Focus states, keyboard navigation

## 🛠 Development

### Full Stack Scripts (from project root)

```bash
./start-dev.sh       # 🚀 Start both frontend + backend
./stop-dev.sh        # 🛑 Stop both servers
./status-dev.sh      # 📊 Check server status
./start-backend.sh   # 🎵 Start backend only
```

### Frontend Scripts (from frontend directory)

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run test:e2e     # Run E2E tests (Chrome & Firefox)
npm run test:e2e:ui  # Run tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:all # Run tests on all browsers
```

### Tech Stack
